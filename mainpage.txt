@section section1 Introduction

A fast 1D gas-grain chemical model by FH (2008). Based upon the OSU gas-grain chemical model. Updated from gg_osu_2006v1d by RTG/VW. 
Rate equations from Hasegawa & Herbst (1992). Modified rates following Caselli et al. (1998)\n\n
Stiff solver for sparse Jacobians: LSODES/ODEPACK (Hindmarsh 1983)\n
Turbulent mixing implemented through first order operator splitting\n

The simulation binary is <b>nautilus</b>. The binary to be used for ASCII output generation is <b>nautilus_outputs</b>.

@section section_example How To Use
A folder containing an example simulation is available in example_simulation/

To use the code, my advice would be to have one folder for the code, in a specific location. Then, in another location, you can 
create as many folders as you want, with one specific simulation in each folder. 

In my case, I always put my programs in a folder named <b>~/bin</b>. 
Then, to easily access your program, you can modify your commandline preferences by editing your bash profile <b>~/.bashrc</b>. 

To easily go to your program directory via : 
@verbatim
cd $nautilus
@endverbatim
add the following line to your bash profile : 
@code
export nautilus="$HOME/bin/nautilus"
@endcode

To launch Nautilus wherever you want in your server via : 
@verbatim
nautilus
@endverbatim
add the following line to your bash profile : 
@code
alias nautilus="$HOME/bin/nautilus/nautilus"
@endcode

Keep in mind that typing
@verbatim
> cd -
@endverbatim
in your Terminal, you will go back to the previous directory (not the parent one, the previous one). Typing this command several 
times allow you to switch easily between two folders.

@section section_commands Basic commands

Compile <b>nautilus</b>
@code
Makefile.py
@endcode

See all compilation options
@code
Makefile.py help
@endcode

Compile <b>nautilus_outputs</b>
@code
Makefile.py output
@endcode

Generate Doxygen documentation (all errors will be stored in a <b>doxygen.log</b> file)
@code
doxygen doxygen.conf 2>doxygen.log
@endcode

@section section_input Input files

Input files have a <b>*.in</b> extension. All parameters file can have comments, either a full line or the end of a line. The comment character being the '!' character. 
Blanck lines are ignored

@li <b>parameters.in</b> : parameter file of the code, with various flags
@li <b>abundances.in</b> : Give initial abundances for a set of species (a reduced number or all. Default minimum values are applied 
for those that do not exist in this file.
@li <b>element.in</b> : name and mass in AMU of all elemental species existing in the simulation
@li <b>gas_reactions.in</b> : Reaction that occurs in gas phase
@li <b>gas_species.in</b> : species that are involved in gas phase reactions
@li <b>grain_reactions.in</b> : Reactions that occurs on grain surface
@li <b>grain_species.in</b> : Species that are involved in grain surface reactions
@li <b>activation_energies.in</b> : Activation energy for endothermic reactions
@li <b>surface_parameters.in</b> : various energies and parameters for diffusion and movements on the grain surface

@section section_output Output files
<b>*.out</b> files are output files. <b>*.tmp</b> files are file that are generated at each timestep, either to continue a 
simulation or check if there is a problem

<b>*.ab</b> files are ASCII files generated by nautilus_outputs from the binaries <b>abundances.*.out</b>. 
One file per species in a folder named <b>ab</b>. 

@li <b>abundances.*.out</b> : writing in binary format the abundances of all species at each timestep (one file per timestep-output)
@li <b>abundances.tmp</b> : writing in ASCII format the abundances of all species at the current timestep-output
@li <b>rates.*.out</b> : writing in binary format the critical reactions rates
@li <b>info.out</b> : writing information on the code, in particular about the code version (commit ID and branch)
@li <b>species.out</b> : Writing the list of species and their corresponding index
@li <b>elemental_abundances.tmp/out</b> : writing information about prime elements, their total abundances and mass

@section section_warning Warnings
A lot of warnings are launched by the ODEPACK files. Some of them are more problematic than others that are just deprecated feature 
(even though this is a problem for readability). 

The most problematic is a call of DPREP in the subroutine DIPREP, in opkda1. 

The error returned is the following:
