Notice to create the full chemical model in 2D for protoplanetary disks
V. Wakelam Feb 2017

We have developed a series of fortran and shell procedure to set up the full chemical model 
in 2D for protoplanetary disks. Nautilus will run the chemistry in the vertical direction 
at each radius. The explanations of the physical model can be found in the notice directory.

This series contains:

- disk_structure.f90 is a fortran code to compute the 1D vertical physical structure for 
protoplanetary disks. The disk 2D structure is obtained by computing vertical profiles at 
several radial points. 
This code has been modified at the beginning of 2017 in order to create the vertical 
profiles at several radius at the same time. It was also converted from IDL to fortran to 
avoid funding problems (IDL is not free). 

- source_parameters.in is an input file for disk_structure.f90.

- creation.sh is a shell used to create the various directories corresponding to the 
different radius. Then it copies the chemical files and the physical structure in each 
directory.

- run_disk.sh is a shell to run each model one after the other. 

To create and run a 2D chemical model you need to:

1) Create a directory where you will put everything (for instance 'model1'). 
2) Inside 'model1', put creation.sh and run_disk.sh. Create a directory 'physical_structure'.
3) Inside 'physical_structure' put 'disk_structure.f90', 'source_parameters.in', 
the 'parameter.in' file you want to use.
4) Change the 'source_parameters.in' file according to your scientific case.
5) Compile and run 'disk_structure.f90': 
	gfortran -o disk_structure disk_structure.f90
	./disk_structure
This will create a number of files of the type '001AU.txt' containing the vertical 
physical structure at requested each radius. If you want to change the radius, you have 
to look inside the fortran code. Another type of files are generated: 
'parameters_001AU.txt'. These files are the same as 'parameter.in' (input file for 
nautilus) only the uv_flux was changed according to the radius. 
6) Inside 'model1', create a directory called 'Initial_files' where you put all the 
chemical files needed (abundances.in, activation_energies.in, element.in, 
gas_reactions.in, gas_species.in, grain_reactions.in, grain_species.in, 
surface_parameters.in).
7) In 'model1', run 'creation.sh':
./creation.sh
8) In 'model1', run the codes:
./run_disk.sh

If you have changed the radius in 'disk_structure.f90', change 'creation.sh' and 
'run_disk.sh' accordingly.
